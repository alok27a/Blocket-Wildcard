## Objective
Patients and healthcare resources will always be concerned about data breaches and the exploitation of personal information as healthcare becomes more complex and networked. Patients are further removed from having access to their own medical record history as healthcare facilities move their databases to third-party providers, and the entire infrastructure of healthcare networks is significantly at risk and under attack from malicious actors. Many sensitive and revealing pieces of data may end up being exposed even after a single devastating attack on a centralized storage system.
So, MEDITRACK is a decentralized and secure method for patients to quickly access requests for their medical records and respond to them in order to mitigate this danger.

## What it does
A decentralized, secure, and open medical record solution is MEDITRACK. It is based on the Ethereum blockchain and uses smart contracts to securely store all of your requests for and transactions of medical records. Your medical information is secured on the blockchain and is encrypted.

## How we built it
We have used React.js as our frontend web framework and we have also used Chakra UI. We have implemented our smart contracts using Solidity and MetaMask as our wallet identifiers.

The user needs to first connect his/her Metamask wallet with our website using the Metamask extension. 
And then the user needs to provide the contract address that was provided to them by the primary care provider.

Now, the user has the ability to view all requests made view their "MEDITRACK" smart contract, which is kept on the blockchain, to see all requests made regarding their medical record.

## Challenges we ran into
Time was one of the challenges that we faced. Apart from it we also encountered faced few errors while creating the smart contract and the web application.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
How to create decentralized transactions that can reliably record and encrypt/decrypt transactions using the blockchain and smart contracts.
How to create a completely functional web application with React that users can access and use.
